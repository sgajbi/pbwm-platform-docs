# RFC-0012: Refined Long-Term Platform Vision

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2026-02-22

## Objective

Define a durable platform vision that balances startup velocity with enterprise-grade architecture.

## Vision

Build a configurable Private Banking Wealth Platform that:
- delivers one unified Advisor Workbench UI
- composes independent backend domain services through a lotus-gateway
- supports SaaS and client-hosted deployment modes
- is productizable for banks and wealth firms

## Strategic Tenets

- Standardization first, but incremental implementation.
- Domain ownership clarity over convenience coupling.
- Auditability, observability, and deterministic behavior as non-negotiables.
- Configuration-first architecture for tenant variability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Vision reflected in `Private Banking Wealth Management UI Platform.md`.
- All downstream RFCs align to this tenet set.
