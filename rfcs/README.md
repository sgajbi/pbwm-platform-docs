# Cross-Repository Alignment RFCs

This folder contains architecture RFCs to align:

- `lotus-advise` (current `dpm-rebalance-engine`)
- `lotus-performance` (current `performanceAnalytics`)
- `lotus-core` (current `portfolio-analytics-system`)
- `lotus-gateway` (current `advisor-experience-api`)
- `lotus-report` (current `lotus-report`)
- `lotus-workbench` (current `advisor-workbench`)
- `lotus-platform` (current `pbwm-platform-docs`)

Reference baseline:
- `dpm-rebalance-engine` is the primary engineering standard for automation, testing, and architecture discipline.
- Advanced patterns from the other repositories are absorbed where they improve platform quality.

## Principles

- Standardization over compatibility (no production consumers yet).
- No backward compatibility requirements for naming/structure while pre-live.
- Single responsibility per service.
- No duplicated ownership of domain capabilities.
- UI consumes a unified BFF contract, not raw service contracts.
- Cloud and on-prem deployment parity is required for productization.

## Central Standards

- `Domain Vocabulary Glossary.md`
- `Migration Engineering Quality Standard.md`
