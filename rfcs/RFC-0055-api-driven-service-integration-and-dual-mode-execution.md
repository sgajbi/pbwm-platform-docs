# RFC-0055: API-Driven Service Integration and Dual-Mode Execution

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-02-24

## Owners
- Platform Architecture
- lotus-core
- lotus-performance
- lotus-report
- lotus-manage
- lotus-gateway (lotus-gateway)

## Problem Statement
Service boundaries are defined, but execution and integration rules need explicit enforcement across all applications:
- API-driven integration only,
- no shared database access across services,
- clear support for stateful (service-sourced) and stateless (request-supplied) execution where required.

Without this, services can drift into boundary violations and inconsistent integration patterns.

## Decision
Adopt a strict platform-wide integration and execution model.

## Target Service Responsibilities

### lotus-core (Portfolio Analytics System)
- Authoritative owner of core portfolio processing and core portfolio/reference data.
- Serves positions, transactions, valuations, costs, P&L, portfolio/position time-series, and related foundational data via REST APIs.

### lotus-performance (Performance & Advanced Analytics)
- Owner of advanced analytics via REST APIs.
- Must source required core inputs from lotus-core via API (no direct lotus-core database access).
- Must support stateless mode for isolated testing/external integration via request-supplied data (separate or unified endpoint pattern).

### lotus-report (Reporting & Aggregation Service)
- Owner of reporting and aggregation endpoints.
- Must consume lotus-core and lotus-performance through REST APIs and expose presentation-ready/report-ready outputs.

### lotus-manage (Advisory & Discretionary Portfolio Management)
- Must source required core data from lotus-core via REST APIs.
- May consume lotus-performance and/or lotus-report APIs when advanced analytics/reporting outputs are required.
- Must support stateless mode for simulation and isolated testing via request-supplied data (separate or unified endpoint pattern).

### lotus-gateway (Backend for Frontend)
- Consumes lotus-core, lotus-performance, lotus-report, and lotus-manage APIs.
- Owns orchestration, aggregation, and response shaping for UI contracts.
- Must not own core business logic or reimplement domain engines.

## Integration Rules (Mandatory)
1. All cross-service interactions are API-driven.
2. No shared databases between services.
3. Each service owns its domain and publishes well-defined, documented contracts.
4. Shared vocabulary must align with `Domain Vocabulary Glossary.md`.

## Execution Model Rules
1. `stateful mode`:
   - Service fetches dependencies through upstream APIs and executes with service-managed context.
2. `stateless mode`:
   - Caller passes required data payload directly for deterministic isolated execution.
3. Services supporting both modes may expose:
   - separate endpoints, or
   - a unified endpoint with explicit execution-mode contract.

## Architectural Impact
- Enforces clean bounded contexts and anti-corruption boundaries.
- Improves testability and external integration support through stateless execution.
- Prevents hidden coupling through cross-service database access.

## Risks and Trade-offs
- API orchestration can increase latency and payload size.
- Stateless mode requires stronger input schema/version governance.

## Mitigations
- Contract versioning and explicit schema validation.
- Caching/aggregation at lotus-gateway/lotus-report where appropriate.
- Integration and E2E tests for both execution modes.

## High-Level Implementation Direction
1. lotus-core:
   - Continue exposing canonical core data APIs for downstream services.
2. lotus-performance:
   - Keep lotus-core-sourced mode and standardize stateless mode contracts.
3. lotus-manage:
   - Keep lotus-core-sourced mode and standardize stateless simulation contracts.
4. lotus-report:
   - Centralize reporting/aggregation endpoints and consume lotus-core/lotus-performance APIs only.
5. lotus-gateway:
   - Maintain orchestration-only role and UI-specific contract shaping.

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests per service mode (stateful/stateless where applicable).
- Integration tests validating API-only dependencies (no direct DB coupling).
- End-to-end tests validating lotus-core -> lotus-performance/lotus-report/lotus-manage -> lotus-gateway flows.
